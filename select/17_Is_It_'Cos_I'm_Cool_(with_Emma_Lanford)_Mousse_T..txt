Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Why you dress like me?
Is it honesty or you're just a fool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Why the school kids laugh?
'Cause the papers got it wrong again
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Take a piece of me
Serve me up on a plate in your restaurant
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm fly?
'Cos I said what I said when I said what I said but I didn't say
Is it 'cos I'm hip?
Why you dig my shit?
And you say "I am a fan"? Now I understand
Is it 'cos I'm hot?
Why you mention me in your V.I.P. memories?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
I ain't buying or selling today
I'm just looking around
For some decent conversation
No hidden agenda
No phony pretender
No holding on out for no sweet sixteen
Or peppermint dream
I'll call you, please don't call me
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?

Is it 'cos I'm smart?
Why you break my heart with the lies you tell?
Baby, kiss and tell
Is it 'cos I'm wrong?
That you jump right in with no discipline
Baby, sink or swim
Is it 'cos we're friends?
Why you use my name just to entertain? Yeah, yeah
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Time keeps ticking and running away
And It's taking us fast to a brand new free dimension
Too cool to mention
Well, that's the intention
But some of us are too damn blind to see
It's setting us free (free)
Say goodbye to jealousy
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
No one really cooler
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
(Take a piece of me)
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
(Why you mention me?)
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
(In your V.I.P.)
Is it 'cos I'm...
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Way over cool
Cooler than cool
I am just so cool
And you're not
And I am
And I got it
And you don't
It's so bad
It's a rap
