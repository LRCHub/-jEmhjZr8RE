Why you dress like me, is it honesty or you just a fool?

Why the school kids laugh? 'Cos the papers got it wrong again
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Take a piece of me, serve me up on a plate in your restaurant

Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?

Is it 'cos I'm fly?
'Cos I said what I said when I said what I said but I didn't say
Is it 'cos I'm hip?
Why you dig my shit and you say, I am a fan, now I understand
Is it 'cos I'm hot?
Why you mention me in your V.I.P memories?

I ain't buyin' or sellin' today
I'm just lookin' around
For some decent conversation
No hidden agenda, no phony pretender

No holdin' on out
For my sweet sixteen
Or peppermint dream
I'll call you, please don't call me

Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?

Is it 'cos I'm smart?
Why you break my heart with the lies you tell, baby kiss and tell
Is it 'cos I'm wrong?
That you jump right in with no discipline, baby sink or swim
Is it 'cos we're friends?
Why you use my name just to entertain, yeah, yeah?

Is it 'cos I'm cool?

Time keeps tickin' and runnin' away
And It's takin' us fast
To a brand new free dimension
Too cool to mention

Well, that's the intention
But some of us too damn blind to see
It's settin' us free
Say goodbye to jealousy
