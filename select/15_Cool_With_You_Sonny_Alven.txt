I ain't the kinda girl to take home to your mama
But I'm the girl you gonna wanna take home tonight
I want you next to me, I don't need your number
Turn me on but, baby, don't turn off the lights

Dream about it, I'll make it real for you
Feel my body, the way I move on you
Dream about it, I'll make it real for you
Feel my body, the way I move on you
How you want it? I want it dirty, yeah
All the freaky shit I'm gonna do to you

Is that cool with you?
The spark, I wanna blow your mind
Is that cool with you?
I'm gonna keep you up all night
All the freaky shit I'm gonna do to you
Boy, you love it when I'm getting rude with you
Oh-oh, yeah, is that cool with you?
Is that cool with you?

In my head we're tangled up around each other
In you bed, but in the morning I'll be gone
And you'll get over me, but right now just get under
Tell me anything but don't say I'm the one

Dream about it, I'll make it real for you
Feel my body, the way I move on you
How you want it? I want it dirty, yeah
All the freaky shit I'm gonna do to you

Is that cool with you?
The spark, I wanna blow your mind
Is that cool with you?
I'm gonna keep you up all night
All the freaky shit I'm gonna do to you
Boy, you love it when I'm getting rude with you
Oh-oh, yeah, is that cool with you?
Is that cool with you?

Is that cool with you?
Oh-oh, yeah, oh-oh, yeah
Is that cool with you?
Oh-oh, yeah, oh-oh, yeah
Is that cool with you?
Oh-oh, yeah, oh-oh, yeah
Is that cool with you?
Is that cool with you?
